# RED BEAR OS BUILD SYSTEM — PROJECT KNOWLEDGE BASE

**Generated:** 2026-04-12 (P1/P2 complete)
**Toolchain:** Rust nightly-2025-10-03 (edition 2024)
**Architecture:** Microkernel OS in Rust, ~38k files, ~294k LoC Rust
**Target Hardware**: AMD64 bare metal, with AMD and Intel machines treated as equal-priority Red Bear OS targets

## OVERVIEW

Red Bear OS build system orchestrator — fetches, builds, and packages ~100+ Git repositories
into a bootable Redox image. Uses a Makefile + Rust "cookbook" tool + TOML configs.
Languages: Rust (core), C (ported packages), TOML (config), Make (build orchestration).

RedBearOS should be treated as an overlay distribution on top of Redox in the same way Ubuntu
relates to Debian:

- Redox is upstream
- Red Bear carries integration, packaging, validation, and subsystem overlays on top
- upstream-owned source trees are refreshable working copies
- durable Red Bear state belongs in `local/patches/`, `local/recipes/`, `local/docs/`, and tracked
  Red Bear configs

If we can fetch refreshed upstream sources, reapply our overlays, and rebuild successfully, the
project is in the right shape for long-term maintenance.

```

## BUILD FLOW

```
make all
  → mk/config.mk (ARCH, CONFIG_NAME, FILESYSTEM_CONFIG)
  → mk/depends.mk (check host tools: rustup, cbedgen, nasm, just)
  → mk/prefix.mk (download/setup cross-toolchain if needed)
  → mk/fstools.mk (build cookbook repo binary + fstools)
  → mk/repo.mk (repo cook --filesystem=config/*.toml)
    → For each recipe: fetch source → apply patches → build → stage into sysroot
  → mk/disk.mk (create filesystem.img, harddrive.img, redbear-live.iso)
    → redoxfs-mkfs → redox_installer → bootloader embedding
```

## CONVENTIONS

- **Rust edition 2024**, nightly channel
- **rustfmt.toml**: max_width=100, brace_style=SameLineWhere
- **clippy.toml**: cognitive-complexity-threshold=100, type-complexity-threshold=1000
- **Recipe format**: TOML with `[source]` + `[build]` + optional `[package]`
- **Build templates**: `cargo`, `meson`, `cmake`, `make`, `configure`, `custom`
- **WIP recipes**: Must start with `#TODO` comment explaining what's missing
- **Custom configs**: Name with `my-` prefix (git-ignored by convention)
- **CI**: GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) at root + per-recipe; some have GitHub Actions
- **Syscall ABI**: Unstable intentionally. Stability via `libredox` and `relibc`
- **Drivers**: ALL userspace daemons via scheme system. No kernel-space drivers (except serio)

## ANTI-PATTERNS (THIS PROJECT)

- **DO NOT** suppress errors with `as any` / `@ts-ignore` — use proper `Result` handling
- **DO NOT** use `unwrap()` / `expect()` in library/driver code — pervasive anti-pattern (~14k instances)
- **DO NOT** modify kernel syscall ABI directly — use `libredox` or `relibc`
- **DO NOT** put drivers in kernel space — all drivers are userspace daemons
- **DO NOT** hardcode `/dev/` paths — use scheme paths (`/scheme/drm/card0`)
- **DO NOT** skip patches in WIP recipes — document what's missing with `#TODO`

## PATCH MANAGEMENT

All Red Bear OS modifications to upstream files are kept separately in `local/patches/`.

This is not just a convenience rule; it is a long-term maintenance rule. For fast-moving upstream
areas like relibc, prefer the upstream solution whenever upstream already solves the same problem.
Keep Red Bear patch carriers only for gaps or compatibility work that upstream still does not solve
adequately.

When upstream Redox already provides a package, crate, or subsystem for functionality that also
exists in Red Bear local code, prefer the upstream Redox version by default unless the Red Bear
implementation is materially better. Do not grow lower-quality in-house duplicates as a steady
state.

For quirks and driver support specifically:

- prefer improving and using the canonical `redox-driver-sys` path,
- avoid maintaining separate lower-quality quirk engines when the same functionality belongs in
  `redox-driver-sys`,
- if duplication is temporarily unavoidable, treat it as convergence work to remove, not as a
  permanent design.

    └── 004-docs-and-cleanup.patch  # README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, deleted upstream files
```

### Protection Mechanism

1. **Recipe patches** (`kernel/redox.patch`, `base/redox.patch`): Canonical copy lives in
   `local/patches/`. The recipe directory contains a **symlink** to it:
   ```
   recipes/core/kernel/redox.patch → ../../../local/patches/kernel/redox.patch
   recipes/core/base/redox.patch   → ../../../local/patches/base/redox.patch
   ```
   The build system follows symlinks transparently. Patches are never touched by `make clean`
   or `make distclean`. Only `local/` modifications affect them.

2. **Build-system patches**: Generated via `git diff` against the upstream base commit.
   These serve as a backup — the working tree already has patches applied (via git commits).
   If upstream update via rebase fails, these can be applied from scratch.

3. **Custom recipes**: Live entirely in `local/recipes/` with symlinks into `recipes/`:
   ```
   recipes/drivers/linux-kpi       → ../../local/recipes/drivers/linux-kpi
   recipes/gpu/amdgpu              → ../../local/recipes/gpu/amdgpu
   recipes/system/firmware-loader  → ../../local/recipes/system/firmware-loader
   ... etc
   ```

### Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `local/scripts/apply-patches.sh` | Apply all build-system patches + create recipe symlinks |
| `local/scripts/sync-upstream.sh` | Fetch upstream + rebase Red Bear OS commits + verify symlinks |

### Updating from Upstream

```bash
# Automated (preferred):
./local/scripts/sync-upstream.sh              # Rebase Red Bear OS onto latest upstream
./local/scripts/sync-upstream.sh --dry-run    # Preview conflicts first

# Manual:
git remote add upstream-redox https://github.com/redox-os/redox.git  # once
git fetch upstream-redox master
git rebase upstream-redox/master             # replays Red Bear OS commits on new upstream

# Nuclear option (if rebase fails badly):
git rebase --abort
git reset --hard upstream-redox/master
./local/scripts/apply-patches.sh --force     # apply from scratch via patch files
```

## AMD-FIRST INTEGRATION PATH

See `local/docs/CONSOLE-TO-KDE-DESKTOP-PLAN.md` for the canonical desktop path plan and `local/docs/AMD-FIRST-INTEGRATION.md` for deeper AMD-specific technical detail.

**Target**: AMD64 bare metal, with AMD and Intel machines treated as equal-priority hardware targets.

**amdgpu is 6M+ lines — 18x larger than Intel i915. LinuxKPI compat approach mandatory.**

### Bare Metal Boot Status

| Component | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| UEFI boot | ✅ | x86_64 bootloader functional |
| AMD CPUs | ✅ | Ryzen Threadripper 128-thread verified |
| ACPI | ✅ Boot-baseline complete | RSDP/SDT checksums, MADT types 0x4/0x5/0x9/0xA, LVT NMI, FADT shutdown/reboot; see `local/docs/ACPI-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` for remaining ownership/robustness work |
| ACPI shutdown | ✅ | PM1a/PM1b S5 via `\_S5` AML |
| ACPI reboot | ✅ | Reset register + keyboard controller fallback |
| ACPI power | ✅ | `\_PS0`/`\_PS3`/`\_PPC` AML methods available |
| x2APIC/SMP | ✅ | Multi-core works |
| IOMMU | 🚧 | QEMU first-use proof now passes; real hardware validation still open |
| AMD GPU | 🚧 | MMIO mapped, DC port compiles, MSI-X wired, no hardware validation yet |

### Phased Roadmap (historical P0–P6)

> **Note:** The P0–P6 numbering below is the historical hardware-enablement sequence.
> The canonical current desktop path plan uses a new Phase 1–5 structure documented in
> `local/docs/CONSOLE-TO-KDE-DESKTOP-PLAN.md` (v2.0, 2026-04-16).

| Phase | Duration | Delivers |
|-------|----------|----------|
| ~~P0: Fix ACPI for AMD~~ | ~~4-6 weeks~~ | ✅ Materially complete — boots on modern AMD bare metal; see `local/docs/ACPI-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` for forward work |
| ~~P1: Driver infrastructure~~ | ~~8-12 weeks~~ | ✅ Complete — redox-driver-sys + linux-kpi + firmware-loader + pcid /config + MSI-X (compiles) |
| ~~P2: AMD GPU display~~ | ~~12-16 weeks~~ | ✅ Complete — redox-drm + AMD DC port + Intel driver (compiles, no HW validation) |
| ~~P3: POSIX + input~~ | ~~4-8 weeks~~ | 🚧 Build-side work substantially complete — relibc gaps exported to downstream consumers, evdevd/udev-shim/libevdev/libinput/D-Bus build; runtime validation still open |
| P4: Wayland compositor | 4-6 weeks | 🚧 Partial — libwayland/Qt6 Wayland/Mesa EGL+GBM+GLES2/Qt6 OpenGL now build, but compositor/runtime validation is still incomplete |
| ~~P5: DML2 enablement~~ | ~~partial~~ | 🚧 DML2 config enabled, 63 DML source files in build, TTM compiled, libdrm amdgpu ✅, `iommu` daemon now builds; hardware validation still open |
| P6: KDE Plasma | 12-16 weeks | 🚧 In progress — Qt6 ✅, KF6 32/32 ✅, Mesa EGL/GBM/GLES2 ✅, kf6-kcmutils ✅, kf6-kwayland ✅, kdecoration ✅, KWin 🔄 building |

### Canonical Desktop Path (current plan)

The current execution plan uses a three-track model with new Phase 1–5 numbering:
- **Phase 1:** Runtime Substrate Validation (4–6 weeks)
- **Phase 2:** Wayland Compositor Proof (4–6 weeks)
- **Phase 3:** KWin Desktop Session (6–10 weeks)
- **Phase 4:** KDE Plasma Session (8–12 weeks)
- **Phase 5:** Hardware GPU Enablement (12–20 weeks, parallel with 3–4)

See `local/docs/CONSOLE-TO-KDE-DESKTOP-PLAN.md` for full detail.

**Total to software-rendered KDE Plasma**: 22–34 weeks (~6–8 months) with 2 developers.
**Total to hardware-accelerated KDE Plasma**: 34–54 weeks (~8–13 months) with 2 developers.

### Critical Path
```
Phase 1 (runtime substrate) → Phase 2 (software compositor) → Phase 3 (KWin session) → Phase 4 (KDE Plasma)
                               Phase 5 (hardware GPU, parallel with Phases 3–4)
```

### Custom Crates (P1/P2)
1. `redox-driver-sys` — `local/recipes/drivers/redox-driver-sys/source/` — Safe Rust wrappers for scheme:memory, scheme:irq, scheme:pci + hardware quirks system (`src/quirks/`)
2. `linux-kpi` — `local/recipes/drivers/linux-kpi/source/` — C headers translating Linux kernel APIs → redox-driver-sys; includes `pci_get_quirk_flags()` C FFI for quirk queries. **GPU and Wi-Fi drivers only — linux-kpi does NOT cover USB.** It provides PCI, DMA, IRQ, DRM, networking (ieee80211/nl80211/mac80211), firmware, and related kernel infrastructure headers, but contains zero USB headers, USB device ID tables, or USB driver implementations.
3. `redox-drm` — `local/recipes/gpu/redox-drm/source/` — DRM scheme daemon (AMD + Intel drivers); consumes quirk flags for MSI/MSI-X fallback and DISABLE_ACCEL
4. `firmware-loader` — `local/recipes/system/firmware-loader/source/` — scheme:firmware for GPU blobs
5. `amdgpu` — `local/recipes/gpu/amdgpu/source/` — AMD DC C port with linux-kpi compat; can query quirks via `pci_has_quirk()` FFI
6. `redbear-sessiond` — `local/recipes/system/redbear-sessiond/source/` — Rust D-Bus session broker exposing `org.freedesktop.login1` subset for KWin (uses `zbus`)
7. `redbear-dbus-services` — `local/recipes/system/redbear-dbus-services/` — D-Bus activation `.service` files and XML policy files for system and session buses

All custom work goes in `local/` — see `local/AGENTS.md` for overlay usage.

## NOTES

- Build requires Linux x86_64 host, 8GB+ RAM, 20GB+ disk
- QEMU used for testing (make qemu). VirtualBox also supported
- The `repo` binary (cookbook CLI) may crash with TUI in non-interactive environments — use `CI=1`
- No git submodules — external repos managed via recipe source URLs and repo manifests
- Historical integration report removed (2026-04-16); see `local/docs/DESKTOP-STACK-CURRENT-STATUS.md` for current state

## SUBSYSTEM PRIORITY AND ORDER

Red Bear OS should treat low-level controllers, USB, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth as first-class subsystem
targets.

Current execution order:

1. low-level controllers / IRQ quality / runtime-proof
2. USB controller and topology maturity
3. Wi-Fi native control-plane and one bounded driver path
4. Bluetooth host/controller path
5. desktop/session compatibility layers on top of those runtime services

Current blocker emphasis:

- low-level controller quality blocks reliable USB and Wi-Fi validation
- USB maturity blocks the realistic first Bluetooth transport path
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth should not be treated as optional polish; both remain missing subsystem work
  that must be implemented fully, but in the right order
